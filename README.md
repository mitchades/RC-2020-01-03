This is the code to generate the answer to FiveThirtyEight's Riddler Classic of 2020-01-03: **What combination of letters (not counting S) creates the highest-scoring honeycomb in The New York Times' Spelling Bee game?**

My answer, for 3898 points:
```
 T E 
A R I
 N G
```

# [solve.py](./solve.py)
Requires Python 3.8 as written because there are a couple of times I use the new `:=` operator for assignment in an expression. If you make the obvious changes to the code where they pop up, you can run this in Python 3.1.

# [wordlist.txt](./wordlist.txt)
The 537 words you can spell with the above honeycomb.

# [top20.md](./top20.md)
The 20 best honeycombs.

What I sent to Mr. Wissner-Gross, prettied up somewhat.
